A React.js list polling app with an interactive admin area and the ability to insert lists with a simple shortcode

== Description ==

The plugin gives you the ability to insert lists with a shortcode. The lists are React.js apps, allowing the user to vote up and down their favourite items. The plugin also comes with a single page React back end for managing and editing the lists.

Features:

A single page admin area.
Lists insertable by simple short code.
List items are added as a custom post type for easy content management.
Users are cookied so they can only vote for each list item once, with the item turning red or green depending on their vote.
Add as many list items, and create as many lists as you like.
List re-sorts itself to allow items to move up and down depending on rank
